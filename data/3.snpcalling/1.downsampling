Samples at higher coverage should be downsampled
  
java -jar /mnt/DiscoC/maria/picard/picard.jar DownsampleSam \
I="$i"_mkdup_30.bam \
O="$i"_2_mkdup_30.bam \
P=0.65

Careful with the Readgroup. To check which it is do:
samtools view -H sample_mkdup_30.bam | grep '^@RG'

You will see that it has teh same ID than the high coverage sample. We need to change this.
