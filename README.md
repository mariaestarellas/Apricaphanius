# M&M
We sequenced X individuals of _Apricaphanius iberus_ from W localitites and Y of _Apricaphanius baeticus_. A map showing all localities is included in **Fig1**. 
Coverage of 10X for all individuals, with the exception of CN21596 and CN21784 which are at 15X Illumina. The reference genome from Doadrio. 

# PSMC
For 2 individuals, one from Tarragona and one from Griona (CN21596 from Madrigueres TGN and CN21784 from Bassa del Pi GIR) both at high coverage 13.8X and 13.65X. 
This analysis is run individually and looks at effective population size ofer time. Concretetely, in our case both populations show a declining tendency, starting in both cases around 10^5 years ago. For the individual from TGN there is a following increase with is then followed again by a second decline. The individual from GIR only drops.
