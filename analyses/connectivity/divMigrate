#This is the R funtion. For the input file we need Arlequin genotype file format (.arp), or the genepop file format. Stat is which statistic should be used to calculate relative migration between samples, d_jost is the default. 
divMigrate(infile = file.arp, outfile = iberus, boots = 100, stat = "all",  filter_threshold = 0, plot_network = FALSE,  plot_col = "darkblue", para = FALSE)

infile
Input genepop file name or path.
outfile
String prefix to be added to the results directory. If left NULL, no networks will be written to file.
boots
The number of bootstrap iteration to carry out for calculating mean relative migration and 95% confidence intervals.
stat
A character string indicating which statistic should be used to estimate relative migration between populations. The argument accepts one of the following: "d" (Jost's D), "gst" (Nei's Gst), "Nm" (Alcala et al, 2014) or "all" (all of the preceeding statistics; default).
filter_threshold
The minimum relative migration value for which edges in the networks should be displayed.
plot_network
A logical argument, specifying whether migration results should be plotted in a network.
plot_col
Defines the colour of edges in networks. Default is set to "darkblue".
para
A logical argument, specifying if multiple CPUs should be used when available.
