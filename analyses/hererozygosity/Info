Very low heterozygosities for allozyme loci indicate severe effects of small population size (population bottlenecks or metapopulation dynamics that severely reduced the level of genetic variation relative to that expected or found in comparable species).
High heterozygosity means lots of genetic variability.  Low heterozygosity means little genetic variability.  Often, we will compare the observed level of heterozygosity to what we expect under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).  If the observed heterozygosity is lower than expected, we seek to attribute the discrepancy to forces such as inbreeding.  If heterozygosity is higher than expected, we might suspect an isolate-breaking effect (the mixing of two previously isolated populations).
